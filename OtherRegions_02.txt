Greater amberjacks mature around 4 years old, and migrate in late spring to early summer (March to June) to reproduce. They migrate to deeper water to spawn, producing their young near shipwrecks or large objects as a safe haven.

Females are much larger than males, and have a longer life expectancy. The maximum lifespan for females is 17 years, whilst the average is 10 due to popular demand for them in big game fishing and as a high-quality food fish.

Amberjacks are not at top of the food chain in their habitat, so are prey for yellowfin tuna, sharks, and other larger fish.
